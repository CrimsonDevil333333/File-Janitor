## Features

* **Duplicate File Finder**: Scans directories to find and manage files with identical content using a two-phase check (size then hash). Features multi-select and a "Smart Select" option for easy cleanup.
* **Large File Finder**: Quickly locates files that exceed a user-specified size, helping you identify the biggest storage hogs.
* **File Type Analyzer**: Provides a summary of disk space usage broken down by file extension, showing what's taking up your space.
* **Empty Folder Cleaner**: Recursively finds and deletes empty subdirectories to reduce clutter.
* **Modern GUI**: A clean, tabbed interface with toggleable Light/Dark themes.
* **Safe & Responsive**: Operations run in a background thread to keep the UI responsive, with a cancel button available.
* **Export & Save**: Export scan results to a `.csv` file and have your window settings saved for the next session.
